       <h1>Clever Cat Title Here</h1>
       <p>I got to bring my cat, Keeks, home on April 16th, 2018. He was one of four kittens in a litter that my friend's cat had given birth to. When I went to my friend's house to choose a kitten, Keeks was the only one brave enough to come say 'Hello'. Since that moment, he's been my favorite little guy. This webpage is going to be a Keeks appreciation page, so that everyone else can see how great he is.&#128516;</p>

        <p>I got Keeks when he was just 6 weeks old. He was so tiny, curious, and not afraid of anything. </p>

      <h2>Turning Into a Big Fluff</h2>
      <p>As Keeks started growing, he turned into a giant fluff ball. This came as a bit of a surprise to me because his mom was a shorthair with all black fur. I came to the conclusion that his dad must have been a Maine Coon.</p>

    <p>I had to get a new vacuum because of all the hair clumps he leaves around the apartment. He's worth it though.</p>
